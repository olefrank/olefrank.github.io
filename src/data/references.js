			'I had the pleasure of working directly with Ole at OmniCar A / S, where we had a close sparring in our daily work. We had a division of labor where I myself primarily did backend tasks and Ole did frontend tasks, which took place in React.js and various other technologies such as TypeScript, Material UI and Cypress.io.\n\nWe formed a good team and I could steal that the task was performed when it was survived to ham, large set regardless of the nature of the task. Ole is thorough and thoughtful in his solutions that are not to be overlooked. The result is of a good quality, and he is not afraid to tell if he has an opinion that things can do better, and he also does not refrain from doing and extra effort if he is not himself satisfied with the result.\n\nOle is also a good colleague on the personal level, where he is generally friendly and welcoming and very natural in his social tone. I will miss his warm being and do not hesitate to recommend him as your next colleague!',

In Jyllands-Posten Ole was constantly challenged to learn and master new technology and frameworks, often on his own, and every time he managed to do that. I’m sure that Ole will continue to grow as a developer, and I’m sure that he will be a great asset in any future employment.',

			'Ole is excellent in learning new things and acquiring an overview. Ole works independently, methodical and responsible with the tasks he is given. Customer feedback has also been very positive, both when counseling, solving problems and teaching. In addition, Ole has been a great colleague with a good sense of humor, even in the somewhat stressful situations that may arise due to hard deadlines. I hereby give Ole my very best recommendation.',
